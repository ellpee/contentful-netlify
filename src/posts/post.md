As a designer, I try to immerse myself in User Experience Design. Whether you’re a beginner in the field or a seasoned vet, you need to be updated with the latest and greatest. I decided to share a few social media accounts that I follow religiously. I’m inspired daily just by clicking on their social media handles. Follow my leaders and enjoy.<!-- end -->
